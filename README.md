## About Me
My name is Ryan and I'm a  Senior at Universtiy of Texas at Austin. I am studying Management Information Systems (MIS) with a Certificate in Computer Science.


## My Projects
I enjoy working in Python and Data Science libraries and try to automate as many things as possible to solve my friends and I unique asks and questions.
My next project is working to automate my finances by utilizing more API's to grab and update data. The current plan is to implement Chase and Plaid for my [budgeting project](https://github.com/rjinnette/Budget)

## Goals
I plan to recruit and work in some sort of Data Analytics/Science role where I can have hands on experience with data in a full tech stack. I have prior experience with Python, SQL, R, .js, HTML, and C#
and hope to leverage these skills in a full-time position.

Thanks for reading and Hook 'Em ðŸ¤˜
